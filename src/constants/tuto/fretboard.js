            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>Almost all beginner, we all begin to play our favorite band song by following a tabulation sheet <br />
            But by doing that, we have no clue of what chord or what note we play. But in Jazz music, we can't rely only on tab sheets <br />
            Only the chords and melodies lead's parts are wrottens and we have to relate on that to play the backing parts or to improvise. <br />
            And by knowing the name of each notes of the fretboard is the beginning of a long story of learning guitar play.
